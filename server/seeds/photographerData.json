      "bio": "Hello! My name is Amy Olson, and I grew up in a small town in Southeastern Minnesota. I currently live just north of Rochester, Minnesota with my husband. My passion for photography began at a young age when I was constantly taking photos of family and friends. I finally made it a career, and after several years of experience in portrait photography, Simply Class was established in 2010. I specialize in natural light photography for all types of sessions including weddings, seniors, families, and newborns. I thrive on the excitement of each event, capturing those perfect and special moments with creativity and class. I offer high-end digital photography and am available nationwide and for destination weddings. Please contact me by phone or email for more information. I'd love to enjoy a cup of coffee with you to discuss details.",
